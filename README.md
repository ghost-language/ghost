# The Ghost Programming Language
Ghost is a small, object-oriented, embeddable toy scripting language. While object-oriented, Ghost also supports procedural and functional programming styles as well.

Ghost is dynamically typed, runs by a tree-walking interpreter, and has automatic memory management thanks to its implementation through the Go programming language. Ghost's implementation in Go has no dependencies.

## Status
> Currently in active development. Not feature complete.

## Documentation
You will find robust, user friendly, and updated documentation on our [website](https://ghostlang.org/docs).

## Versioning
We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/ghost-language/ghost/tags).

## Installation
### Brew
If you're on mac, you may use `homebrew`:
```
$ brew tap ghost-language/ghost
$ brew install ghost-language/ghost/ghost
```

### Go Install
If you have Go installed, you may use `go install`:
```
go install ghostlang.org/x/ghost
```

### Direct Download
You may download the compiled binaries for your platform from our GitHub [releases](https://github.com/ghost-language/ghost/releases) page.

## Development
- To build and execute Ghost, run `make`.
- To build Ghost, run `make build`.
- To execute tests, run `make test`.

```
$  git clone git@github.com:ghost-language/ghost.git
$  cd ghost
$  make
   Ghost (dev-nightly)
   Press Ctrl + C to exit

>>
```

## CLI
You can execute code written in Ghost in various ways using the CLI.

### REPL
Ghost includes a simple REPL to write and execute Ghost code directly in your terminal. To enter the REPL environment, run `ghost` on its own:

```
$  ghost
   Ghost (dev-nightly)
   Press Ctrl + C to exit

>>
```

### Executing Files
To execute a Ghost source file (`.ghost`), pass either the relative or absolute path of the file to `ghost`. The source file will be executed and then exit back to the terminal.

```
$  ghost examples/fibtc.ghost
   9227465
$
```

### Interactive Mode
Interactive mode allows you to execute a Ghost source file, and then immediately jump into a REPL session with the state of the source file still intact. To enter interactive mode, pass the `-i` flag to `ghost`.

```
$  ghost -i examples/fibtc.ghost
   (executed in: 350.374Âµs)
>> x
   9227465
>>
```

## Compiling Templates
Ghost comes bundled with its own web server, making it easy for you to build and launch websites powered by Ghost on the backend. As such, we also provide the means for Ghost to report errors during development within your browser. These are powered by templates utilizing the TailwindCSS framework. To work with these templates and compile down the CSS, we use npm and PostCSS.

```
npm install
npm run watch
```

Running `watch` will start the PostCSS process and watch our `.html` files for changes, recompiling our CSS automatically. When you're happy with the final code, just compile everything down for production:

```
npm run production
```

This will compile the final assets in a condensed format with the smallest filesize possible.

## Releasing
Ghost is hosted and distributed through GitHub. We utilize [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com) to automate the release process. GoReleaser will build all the necessary binaries, publish the release and publish the brew tap formula. The following steps outline the process for maintainers of Ghost:

1. Ensure you have a GitHub token with `repo` access saved to your environment:
  ```
  export GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GH_TOKEN"
  ```
2. Ensure the internal version reference is updated:
   ```go
   // version/version.go

   var (
      Version = "x.y.z"
   )
   ```
3. Create a new tag:
  ```
  $ git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release description"
  $ git push origin vx.y.z
  ```
4. Run GoReleaser:
  ```
  $ goreleaser
  ```
